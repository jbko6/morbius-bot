^(?=.*\bmorbius\b)(?=.*\bbad\b).*$,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Morbius. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Morbius’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Vampire literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Morbius truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Morbius’s existential catchphrase ""I am Morbius,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Daniel Espinosa’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. ??

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Morbius tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 morbIQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid ??"

^(?=.*\bmorbius\b)(?=.*\bhot\b|.*\bhorny\b|.*\blove\b).*$,"I'm a nurse and I was just going about my day at work. There's this doctor that I think is pretty cool but pretty unapproachable. So around the time my shift was ending, I was changing into my clothes when I turn around into a very disgruntled looking Dr. Michael. I asked him if he was feeling okay but he looks at me with very animal looking eyes (hot!).

""I'm thirsty"" he said. I asked if he wanted some water but he said ""I'm thirsty for you"". Now this is when I start feeling pretty hot and horny. He pushed me against the wall and leaned in close. He whispered only three words. ""It's Morbin' time"" and instantly I knew that I was here to serve a higher purpose, a higher being.

I didn't even get to change. He Morbed me so hard all night. We both were so close. I can still hear his grunts and moans. A few co-workers who walked into the room just bolted out quickly with wide eyes. It's been two days since I got Morbed and I still can't walk right.

I don't think any other person can make me feel the wild and brutal way he made me feel. I felt like an animal. I have served my purpose. I'll never feel the same again with anyone else. I can no longer be satisfied."
^(?=(?=.*\bmorbius\b)(?=.*\bcatchphrase\b)|.*\bit's morbin time\b|\bits morbin time\b).*$,"It's so fucking great, the adrenaline made me legitimately shit my pants, and the dialog writing was phenomenal. When morbius said ""It's Morbin time."" It was such an amazing way to deal with current problems of our society. I actually got up and cheared when he said ""I'm venom. Just kidding I'm dr. Micheal morbius at your service"" such a beautiful way to showcase all their properties that made me stand up and chear, pants dripping with my shit and all. When they said ""To humans it's deadly to bats its lethal"" I actually came. I wasn't able to stop Cumming because the whole movie was so amazing that I was literally erect. Eventually I unzipped my pants and I started jacking off to this masterpiece. Security came to escort me out but luckily there was a fight scene just then so I was able to fight them off using the moves in the movie. 100/10 amazing movie, made me shit, cum and fight."
